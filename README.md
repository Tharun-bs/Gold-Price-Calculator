Gold Rate Calculator Web App
The Gold Rate Calculator is a lightweight web application built using PHP and MySQL that enables users to dynamically calculate the total price of gold jewelry items based on various factors such as gold rate, weight, making charges, wastage, and tax percentages.

The application supports different jewelry categories (like rings, necklaces, bangles, earrings, etc.) and provides real-time price breakdowns for each item. It can be used by jewelry businesses, gold rate analysts, or consumers who want a quick and transparent price estimate.

Designed with a user-friendly interface and backend logic, this project demonstrates full-stack integration, data processing, and conditional logic in PHP while also interacting with structured data in a MySQL database.
